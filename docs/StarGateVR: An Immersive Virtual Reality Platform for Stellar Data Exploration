# StarGateVR: An Immersive Virtual Reality Platform for Stellar Data Exploration

## Abstract

We present **StarGateVR**, a virtual reality (VR) tool for immersive, collaborative exploration of stellar data, developed independently by Immersive Science LLC in collaboration with researchers at the Rochester Institute of Technology. StarGateVR enables scientists to visualize and interact with multi-dimensional astrophysical catalogs such as Gaia DR3 in an intuitive 3D environment, offering powerful capabilities for identifying and analyzing spatial and kinematic structures in the local galaxy.

We describe the software’s technical design, its user interface and interactive filtering features, and its application to scientific case studies including nearby young moving groups and open clusters. StarGateVR also supports multi-user collaboration and public outreach. We discuss its value in research workflows, education, and the broader adoption of immersive tools in astronomy.

## 1. Introduction

The scale and complexity of modern astrophysical datasets—particularly stellar catalogs such as those from ESA's Gaia mission—pose significant challenges to traditional desktop data exploration. These datasets are high-dimensional, often requiring analysis of spatial and kinematic correlations across millions of stars.

**StarGateVR** is a standalone virtual reality application designed to address this challenge by immersing researchers in their data. Developed independently and in parallel with other VR astronomy efforts (e.g., iDaVIE), StarGateVR leverages commodity VR hardware to offer researchers an intuitive, spatial interface to datasets like Gaia DR3. Its goal is to support both exploratory discovery and hypothesis refinement through an immersive environment, enhancing human pattern recognition and collaborative research.

This paper outlines the development and capabilities of StarGateVR, and demonstrates its application to real science cases involving young stellar groups and open clusters.

## 2. Scientific Motivation

### 2.1 Challenges of Stellar Data Exploration

Astrophysical catalogs such as Gaia DR3 deliver six-dimensional phase space information (position + velocity), along with photometric and spectroscopic parameters. Detecting spatial and kinematic groupings—such as moving groups or clusters—often requires multi-dimensional filtering and inspection. This process can be unintuitive when using only 2D projections.

### 2.2 Rationale for a VR Tool

Virtual reality offers a compelling solution for examining complex spatial data. StarGateVR allows researchers to “walk through” a star catalog, using visual depth cues to uncover spatial correlations that may be difficult to detect in 2D. Interactive filtering ("gating") further enables the isolation of substructures for detailed study.

### 2.3 Collaborative and Educational Potential

In addition to individual exploration, StarGateVR supports multi-user collaboration, enabling geographically distributed teams to analyze data together in shared VR sessions. A public-facing version, **StarGateVR: Constellations**, demonstrates its applicability to outreach and education.

## 3. StarGateVR Platform Overview

### 3.1 System Architecture

StarGateVR is built in Unity and optimized for standalone Meta Quest VR headsets. It supports:

- Custom data import (e.g., Gaia subsets)  
- Flexible axis mapping (e.g., position, velocity, color–magnitude)  
- Interactive filtering and selection  
- Multi-user networked sessions  

Data points are rendered as 3D particles with user-defined color and size mappings. Built-in presets allow toggling between views (e.g., spatial coordinates and HR diagrams).

### 3.2 User Interface

A floating VR menu provides access to data loading, axis controls, gating tools, and collaboration settings. Users navigate datasets using intuitive motion, selection, and scaling gestures. Gating sliders allow real-time filtering in 3D.

### 3.3 Collaboration Features

Multiple users can join shared sessions with voice chat and synchronized interaction. Team members appear as avatars and can point, annotate, and explore the dataset together. This has proven effective for joint research across institutions.

## 4. Scientific Applications

### 4.1 Nearby Young Moving Groups (NYMGs)

Using StarGateVR, RIT researchers analyzed Gaia DR3 data to recover and expand member lists of several NYMGs. By exploring proper motion and spatial clustering interactively, they identified ≈370 new candidate members across groups like β Pictoris, TW Hydrae, and Argus. VR filtering helped distinguish overlapping associations and prompted reevaluation of group memberships.

### 4.2 Open Cluster Analysis: NGC 2287

StarGateVR enabled 3D inspection of cluster structure and proper motion space in the Little Beehive open cluster. Researchers identified additional candidate members and visualized a bifurcated main sequence, correlated with stellar rotation. The immersive environment made CMD patterns and spatial relationships more apparent than in 2D plots.

### 4.3 Educational and Outreach Use

The **Constellations** module, distributed via the Meta Quest store, offers users a guided tour of bright stars and constellation geometry from a 3D perspective. This application supports astronomy education and public engagement, helping users intuitively grasp concepts like parallax and 3D star distribution.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Enhancing Research Workflows

StarGateVR integrates well into the early phases of data exploration, offering a complementary method to standard scripting and plotting. It supports hypothesis formation and guided discovery, especially when dealing with rich, multi-dimensional datasets.

### 5.2 Limitations and Challenges

VR headset adoption in astronomy is still limited. Data preprocessing is required to prepare datasets for import, and large datasets (>10⁵ stars) may require subsampling. Integration with analysis environments (e.g., Python) is currently manual, though future versions may include direct scripting or API support.

### 5.3 Future Development

Planned enhancements include:

- Streaming large datasets from online archives  
- Support for volumetric data cubes  
- On-the-fly analytics and clustering  
- Desktop (non-VR) mode for broader accessibility

## 6. Conclusion

StarGateVR demonstrates that immersive tools can make substantial contributions to astronomical research. Its use in studies of stellar kinematics and cluster membership illustrates both its scientific value and usability. By supporting intuitive spatial exploration and collaborative analysis, StarGateVR offers a practical path toward wider adoption of VR in astrophysics.
